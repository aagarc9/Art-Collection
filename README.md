## Description

Art evokes emotions, and it is with this concept in mind that Evoke is developed. 

Evoke is a social media platform that allows users -- artists or those who in any manner are interested in art -- connect by sharing art images. But what sets the application apart is that, in answer to the swipe generation's short attention and demand for quick information, Evoke does not require a user to comment on the image. Although the application posseses a commenting feature, a user can access a particular image and instead of writing down a comment, is given the option to click on an "evoke" or emotion icon that represents the particular feeling the art has drawn from the user. The kind and number of emotions evoked by the said image is indicated on the page.
